## Hi, I'm Shruti 👋

I'm an MCA graduate with a strong interest in building practical,
user-focused applications using Flutter and Figma.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **design, frontend development,
and systems thinking**, especially in real-world problem statements.

### 🌿 Beyond Code
🎨 I paint to express emotions  
📖 I love quiet learning  
✨ I believe technology should feel gentle, not loud
